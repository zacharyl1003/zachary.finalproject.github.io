            <h3>Cybersecurity Analyst — Intern</h3>
            <p><em>Indiana Cyber Network • May 2025 – Present (~6 months)</em></p>
            <p>During my time so far at the Indiana Cyber Network, I have learned how to make Security Documents for small businesses that have allowed me to take the skills that I have learned in the classroom, and apply them to real world application scenarios, which I believe has allowed me to tighten any learning gaps I may have had. Below are the types of documents I have created or assisted with.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>System Security Plans</li>
              <li>Access Control Policies</li>
              <li>Asset Management Setup for Organizations</li>
              <li>Acceptable Use Policies</li>
              <li>Awareness Trainings</li>
              <li>Qualitative Risk Assessments</li>
              <li>Vendor Risk Assessment</li>
              <li>Network Configuration Documents</li>
              <li>Product Comparisons</li>
              <li>Remote Work Policies</li>
              <li>Non Disclosure Agreements</li>
              <li>Risk Assessments</li>
              <li>Business Continuity Plan</li>

            <h3>Cashier</h3>
            <p><em>Meijer • Oct 2022 – Present (~3 years)</em></p>
            <p>At Meijer, I learned how to put the customer first through my interactions with them as a Cashier. I learned that they are the top priority, and that it is our job to serve them. At this job, I was able to achieve a 135% rating, and was recognised as one of the top performing cashiers in the store. I also assited with store conditioning, and cleaning. I deeply beleive that this job rooted my morals in the workplace, and well oriented me to work in Cybersecurity.</p>

            <p>At payless, I was a Courtesy Clerk that was assigned to bring in the carts, bag, and assist customers with find items. This job taught me to work as hard as I can to ensure that that the carts bays were full, and that the customers had an excellent shopping experience.</p>
