# zachary.finalproject.github.io
Welcome to my website! This site is a clean and simple place for me to show the work I’ve done in cybersecurity, computer science, and hands-on projects. I built everything myself with a little help from others and my resources. I used  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so it would be easy to update and load fast on any device.

You’ll find sections that introduce who I am, the services I can help with, and a selection of projects I’ve completed from building a VPN  network with Raspberry Pis to running labs with Wireshark and the Social Engineer Toolkit. I also included my work history, education, and a contact form so people can reach out directly.

My goal with this website is to present myself professionally while showing that I’m serious about cybersecurity and always building new skills. If you want to connect or learn more, feel free to check out my LinkedIn or send a message through the contact section.

This project was uploaded as a file because there are two GitHub repositories associated with it. One I created at work and one created for my final project without using AI. The early portions of the work based repository were done with limited use AI just for small fixes and qustions, but the later parts used it more heavily. That repository is located at: zacharyl1003.github.io. That is why there is a lack of commits. Just wanted to let you know and please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks
